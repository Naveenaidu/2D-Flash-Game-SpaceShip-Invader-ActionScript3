# SpaceShip-Invader
A Flash game remake  of the well known Space-Ship Invaders game made by me. The code is written in ActionScript 3.

Prequisites:-
1. Adobe Flash player(need to be installed to play the game).
2. Adobe Flash Proffessional to edit the game codes.

The complete game is in the file name `game.swf`. It is a prerequsite to have Adobe Flash PLayer to play the game.
The classes for the game are in the `com` folder. You need to open `game.fla` to edit the content.

### NOTE:-
1. This is not a complete version of the game. All the basic movements of the ships and basic game mechanisms are created.
2. Need to add animations to Aliens.
3. Need to add a preloader.
4. Quit the game once the player life's reaches 0. Otherwise it goes off to negative :)-
